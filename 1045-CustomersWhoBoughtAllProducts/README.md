## **Solutions Overview**
### **Grouping Approach (Oracle SQL)**
1. Group by customer_id:
   - Aggregates purchases per customer.
2. Count distinct products per customer:
   - Use COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) to count the number of unique products each customer bought.
3. Compare with total available products:
   - Use a subquery (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product) to determine the total number of products.

- Language: Oracle SQL
- Code:
  ```
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM Customer
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product);
  ```

2. Marketing Insights: Target customers who have completed purchases of all product offerings.
3. Sales Performance Evaluation: Determine how many customers fully explore a storeâ€™s inventory.
