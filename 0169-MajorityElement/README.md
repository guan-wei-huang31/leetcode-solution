# **Majority Element**

## **Problem Statement**
This project provides a solution to find the majority element in a list of integers. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than n/2 times in a list, where n is the size of the list.

**Example Input:**
  ```
  Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]
  Output: 3
  ```

## **Solutions Overview**
### **Single-Pass Approach (Python)**
1. Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each element.
2. Traverse through each element in the list and update the count in the dictionary.
3. Check if the current elementâ€™s count exceeds n/2, where n is the length of the list:
   - If true, return this element as the majority element.
4. If no element meets this condition, return None.
   
- Language: Python
- Code:
  ```
  from typing import List
  
  class Solution:
      def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          # Dictionary to store the frequency of each element
          dict_num = {}
          # Iterate through each number in the list
          for num in nums:
              # Increment the count for the number in the dictionary
              dict_num[num] = dict_num.get(num, 0) + 1
              # Check if the current number count is greater than half the list size
              if dict_num[num] > len(nums) / 2:
                  return num
  
  ```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
  The algorithm traverses the list once, making it linear in time complexity.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  The dictionary requires space to store counts for each unique element.

## **Conclusion**
This single-pass approach efficiently finds the majority element by counting occurrences as it traverses the list. The solution is both simple and effective for the given problem constraints.

### **Future Plans**
- Add implementations in other languages, such as C++, Java.
- Create automated tests to validate edge cases.
- Explore alternative methods to achieve a single-pass solution with minimal memory usage.
